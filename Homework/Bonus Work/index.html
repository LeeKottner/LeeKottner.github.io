       <h1>The League of Nasty Women</h1>
       <h2>An Activism PAC for Progressives</h2>
       <h1><img src="Images/FightTrump.jpg"></h1>
       <p>The League of Nasty Women began on Facebook as a secret group of badass activists and concerned citizens covering the gender, age, and race spectrums, who pledged to counteract and protest the Bigot in Chief's policies and their effects in both small and large ways, politically, day to day, on a personal, local, and national scale.</p>
       <p>With Conservatives firmly entrenched in the House and Senate, undoing the work of decades of progressivism, we are adding election fundraising to our arsenal of civil disobedience, passive resistance, protest, marches, petitions, and constant calls to our representatives.</p>
       <p>Our goal is to support progressive candidates all over the country, but especially in so-called Red states; to fight gerrymandering and voter suppression; and to push for the passage of legislation to:</p>
       <ul>
       	<li>end mass incarceration;</li>
       	<li>punish and end police brutality;</li>
       	<li>provide single-payer healthcare for all;</li>
       	<li>increase the use of sustainable energy;</li>
       	<li>support science;</li>
       	<li>work with world leaders to rectify climate change.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Members have a say in what candidates and legislation we support. But first you have to become one. Join us for a better country and a better world.</p>
