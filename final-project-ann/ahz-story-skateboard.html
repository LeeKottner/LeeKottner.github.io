				</p>

				<p>You catch yourself thinking, “wow, that’s even wilder than the eye make-up I used to wear when I was 17,” or “that’s a real piece of art on the bottom of her skateboard,” or “those are the baggiest-assed jeans I’ve ever seen; she’s practically naked in them, wearing that ripped-up, cropped T-shirt,” or “that snake armlet almost looks real,” or “that can’t be her real skin tone,” or “I’ve never seen a belt with silver arms hanging from it,” or just “crazy kids.”
				</p>

				<p>But she’s not a kid, not dressed like that. Not wearing that mask of cosmetics that makes her unnaturally sallow. Her eyes are lined in green and black, above and below, drawn into slanting, upswept curves at the outside, the lashes thick and luscious, the lids painted gold. Two red tears drip from the outer corner down one cheek. Her brows are nothing more than painted arcs, long and thin and dangerous. Between them is a red bindi embellished with gold, shaped like a flame. Her lipstick is the color of old blood. And her hair! Long matted dreads that were once glossy black are now bleached and colored pink and blue and green and orange, blond, and bronze red—Medusa’s jeweled locks.
				</p>

				On the bottom of her skateboard is a dancing Hindu goddess with skin the color of kohl, poised gracefully on one foot, her multiple arms holding sword and cup and lotus flower, or upraised in blessing, surrounded by a halo of light. The human hands holding the skateboard are long and thin, the nails inches long and curved over, painted red and black: fire against a background of night.
				
				<p>Her name is Amy.</p>
				
				<p>Short for Amrita Choudary, M.A., twenty-four-year-old third generation East Indian American daughter of a college chemistry professor and a lawyer, field acquisitor for the <a href="ahz-index.html">Acme to Zenith Bazaar</a>, and despair of her family.
				</p>

				<p>She gets off at the Union Square station, climbs the steps, puts skateboard to concrete and pushes off through the park and up Broadway, weaving skillfully in and out between strolling couples and late commuters heading home from work. She jumps the curbs like a pro, feet never losing contact with the board, barely brushing the sleeve of a happy hour-bound hipster as she rounds the curve of 18th Street and brakes smoothly in front of the employee entrance to the decemptively mundane A to Z Home Store—affectionaly known as the Ahz—in time to high five another young woman in a pink mohawk.
				</p>

				<p>“Hey, <a href="ahz-housekeeping.html">Raine.</a><!--  [link to "Lightning Tamer"] --> S’up? How’s the BF?”
				</p>

				<p>“Still electric,” the other young woman responds and grins.
				</p> 

				<p>“Excellent. Glad to know somebody’s getting some,” Amy responds.
				</p>

				<p>“Maybe if you weren’t such a maneater,” Raine teases with a wink.
				</p>

				<p>Amy pulls the door open and bares her teeth playfully. In the summer twilight, they look tinged with pink at the edges and gumline. The two young women enter together.
				</p> 

				<p>Inside, they go their separate ways, Raine to what she and the rest of the employees affectionately call <a href="ahz-housekeeping.html">Geekdom</a><!--  [link to catalogue copy] --> on the third floor and Amy to the <a href="ahz-housekeeping.html">kingdom of art and artifacts</a> <!-- [link to catalogue copy] --> on the seventh floor. Amy is in the midst of a huge cataloguing project from her last acquisition trip, head already full of artists and historical dates and religious iconography, the intersections of art and religion and history. The <a href="ahz-housekeeping.html">Acquisitor</a> <!-- [link to "We Can Get It for you Wholesale"] --> is very pleased with her haul this time and the word “promotion” has been mentioned in passing. She has already progressed from clerk to Field Acquisitor in record time, just a year after joining the staff and two years after completing her Master’s degrees in Art History and Comparative Religions. This was only her second trip abroad, but some of the pieces she managed to bring back astound even her. Of course, she had had help the second time around. If you could call it help. ...
